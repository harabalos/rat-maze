Rat Maze
---------------------
Welcome to the Maze Escape repository! This project was developed as part of a third semester course at AUEB University, and it focuses on implementing and utilizing data structures such as stacks, queues, and circular queues.

The goal of the project is to use these data structures and the backtracking algorithm to navigate and escape a maze. The maze is represented using a 2D grid, with walls and paths represented by different characters. The program takes in the maze as an input, and the user can then select which data structure and algorithm to use to escape the maze.

Data Structures Implemented
-------------------------
- Stacks
- Queues
- Circular Queues

Algorithms Implemented
-------------------------
- Backtracking algorithm

How to Run the Project
--------------------------
Clone the repository to your local machine
Import the project into your preferred Java IDE
Run the Main class
Input the maze as prompted
Select the data structure and algorithm to use
Watch the program navigate and escape the maze
Note
The maze should be entered row by row and it should be square.
Please feel free to use and modify the code as you see fit. If you have any questions or issues, please reach out to me through the repository's issue tracker.
