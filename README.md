Rat Maze
---------------------
This project was developed as part of a third semester course at AUEB University, and it focuses on implementing and utilizing data structures such as stacks, queues, and circular queues.

The goal of the project is to use these data structures and the backtracking algorithm to navigate and escape a maze. The maze is represented using a 2D grid, with walls and paths represented by different characters(1,0,E).

Data Structures Implemented
-------------------------
- Stacks
- Queues
- Circular Queues

Algorithms Implemented
-------------------------
- Backtracking algorithm

How to Run the Project
--------------------------
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE
1. Run the Main class
1. Watch the program navigate and escape the maze

Note
----------------------
- E = input position
- 0 = walls
- 1 = road
